<h2>My Game’s Flowchart</h2>
Gameplay
This game is a point-and-click where you have to complete the story by solving riddles.
For example, when you find a key, you will try to use it to open a door/chest which contains an item to use somewhere else. You will also be able to retrieve clues from documents to complete some of the riddles.
Camera : The camera follows the player so that he stays in the middle of the screen.
Player movement : The player moves where a valid click happens.
Element interaction : The player has to be around the element if he wants to interact with it.
As you collect important documents or items throughout the story, another site/page representing the investigation pinboard will fill up and guide you through the story. When you get lost, take a look at it.
Mobile adaptation
Most of the players will be on mobile, so we have to adapt the gameplay for them.
Camera : The camera will be completely free. Players can scroll to the left/right to make the camera move.
Element interaction : The player doesn't have to be around the element if he wants to interact with it.
Graphism
Most of the textures and sprites are from Clocktower released on PlayStation, an excellent point-and-click and survival horror game.
I’ve made the inspector’s sprites by myself using my drawing skills and Photoshop’s mosaic pixelation.
User Interface
We have the main menu, the pause menu, an item inventory, a pinboard and a help page.
They are made of paper and look like parchments. I’ve made them with my drawing or graphist skills.
Objective
Find all the lost children or escape before the criminals come out of the cave.
You have 3 hours.
Story
Since the game has a horrific atmosphere, his story has to be the same. Most of the things that I am going to cite are optional, you can choose the course of your story.


You’re the inspector David Turner who is investigating the mysterious disappearance of several local children near the Whispering Shadows Manor in the United Kingdom in the 90s. As soon as you have learned a little more about the place, you decide to go there alone without telling anyone.
When you ring at the mansion's front door, you receive no answer. You therefore decide to go through the terrace.
